# “COVID-19 temporal dynamic as a hospital management method. Case study of the Martorell Hospital (Martorell, Barcelona)”.

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a better preparation of primary care, hospitalization, and emergency health services. The current investigation of COVID-19 dynamics was carried at the Hospital Fundació Sant Joan de Deu de Martorell (FHSJDM). Methods: The time series of COVID-19 were analized for the period of 2020-2021. To measure seasonality, the Dicky-Fuller test was obtained. The analysis of the results was performed via R-Studio software.Results: Three peaks of cases are observed for January, April, and July 2021. These peaks of hospital cases are correlated with the new cases in the municipality and also with the new cases in Catalonia. The result of the seasonality test has a p-value >0.05, and thus it is accepted that the series is not seasonal for the registry of hospital cases. Discussion: The study of COVID-19 dynamics is relevant to preparing health services. Each peak observed in the 2021 period affected the health services in the hospital FHSJDM, having an increase for new cases, hospitalized patients and total cases for COVID-19.
